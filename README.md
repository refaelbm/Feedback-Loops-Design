Research of Non-Commutative(NC) Funtions of inductor(L) and a capacitor(C) electrical circuit

Theoretical, in some architectures there is mathematical similarity between feedback loop network and an LC electrical circuit, in case the components of the circuit are non-commutative.
We would like to find LC non-commutative funtions, to simplify complex feedback loop network. 

We implemented an encoding method to generate all LC functions on MATLAB under certain varying constraints. 
We used mathematical operations and function compositions in order to generate scalar LC functions. 
Then, we tried to generate MIMO LC functions from those scalar LC functions.

We generated and verified successfully all scalar second-degree LC functions under certain constraints of number of variables, operations and brackets. 
Future research is to find NC-LC-matrix-valued functions.
